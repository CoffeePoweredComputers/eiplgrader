# Research

The eiplgrader tool stems from academic research in computer science education, focusing on innovative assessment methods for conceptual understanding.

## Background

Explain in Plain Language (EIPL) questions are a pedagogical technique used in computer science education to assess students' understanding of complex concepts. Rather than asking students to write code directly, EIPL questions ask students to describe algorithms, data structures, or programming concepts in natural language.

## Educational Impact

Research has shown several benefits of using EIPL questions in CS education:

- **Conceptual Understanding**: Forces students to articulate their understanding beyond syntax
- **Inclusive Assessment**: Reduces barriers for students still developing coding skills
- **Preparation for Communication**: Develops the ability to explain technical concepts clearly

## Current Research

The eiplgrader tool continues to evolve through ongoing research in:

- Improving assessment accuracy through more sophisticated LLM prompting
- Creating more robust evaluation mechanisms for edge cases
- Developing automated feedback mechanisms to guide student learning
- Comparing assessment outcomes between human graders and AI-based evaluation
