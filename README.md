## Installation and Usage

Upcommming features --- To be released April 15th:
* [Prompt Segmentation](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.12216)
* [Function Redefinition Exercises](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.12207)

## Usage

Detailed used can be found in the [eiplgrader documentation](https://hamiltonfour.tech/eiplgrader/).

#### RECOMMENDED: Docker Usage

Given that, at its core, an `eiplquestion` asks students to prompt a model
which then generates arbitrary code it is **_highly recommended_** that this
code only be run in a sandboxed environment. To aid in this, this package 
is also published on [dockerhub](). Its usage is as follows:
```bash
# under development
```

#### Python Usage

In the event you are already running this code in a sandboxed environment you
may opt instead to simply use the python package to develop autograders
independently of the provided docker image. The package is published on 
[pypi](https://pypi.org/project/eiplgrader/) and can be installed using pip.

```bash
pip install eiplgrader
```

An example script is provided in
the
[example.py](https://github.com/CoffeePoweredComputers/eiplgrader/blob/master/examples/example.py)
script in the repository.


```
#
# example.py
#

from eiplgrader.codegen import CodeGenerator
from eiplgrader.tester import CodeTester

code_generator = CodeGenerator(
        "YOUR API KEY HERE"
        )
generated_code = code_generator.generate_code("that adds two numbers.")

# define your tests

test_cases = [
    [[1, 2], 3],
    [[-1, 1], 0],
    [[-1, -1], -2]
]

# Test the generated code
code_tester = CodeTester(generated_code, test_cases)
test_result = code_tester.run_tests()
```
